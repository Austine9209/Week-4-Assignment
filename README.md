# Data Science and Analytics Boot Camp - Week 4 Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions for the Week 4 Assignment of the Data Science and Analytics Boot Camp. The tasks include:

1. Writing a Python program to check whether a string is a palindrome using a stack.
2. Explaining the concept of list comprehension in Python with examples.
3. Explaining compound data types in Python with examples.
4. Writing a function to return bigrams from a string.
5. Writing a function to find the key in a dictionary with the input value closest to the beginning of the list.

## Contents
- `palindrome.py`: A Python script to check if a string is a palindrome using a stack.
- `list_comprehension.py`: A Python script explaining list comprehension with three examples.
- `compound_datatypes.py`: A Python script explaining compound datatypes with three examples.
- `bigrams.py`: A Python script to generate bigrams from a string.
- `closest_key.py`: A Python script to find the closest key in a dictionary.

## 1. Palindrome Check Using a Stack
This script checks whether a given string is a palindrome using a stack data structure. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.
